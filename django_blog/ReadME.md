Here’s a detailed documentation outline for your Django authentication system:

Authentication System Documentation
Overview
The authentication system provides user registration, login, logout, and profile management. It uses Django's built-in authentication views and forms, extended with custom functionality to suit the project requirements.

Features
User Registration:

Allows users to create an account.
Includes a custom registration form with username, email, and password fields.
Login:

Enables registered users to log in to the system.
Redirects authenticated users to their profile page.
Logout:

Logs the user out and displays a confirmation page.
Redirects users to the login page upon logout.
Profile Management:

Allows authenticated users to view and edit their profile details.
Access Control:

Unauthenticated users attempting to access restricted pages (e.g., /profile/) are redirected to the login page.
Detailed Description of Components
1. URL Patterns
The following URL patterns are defined in urls.py:

python
Copier le code
urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='registration/login.html'), name='login'),
    path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(template_name='registration/logout.html'), name='logout'),
    path('register/', views.register, name='register'),
    path('profile/', views.profile, name='profile'),
]
2. Views
Login: Handled by LoginView with the template registration/login.html.
Logout: Handled by LogoutView with the template registration/logout.html.
Register: A custom view renders registration/register.html and handles user registration.
Profile: A custom view renders registration/profile.html for profile management. This view is protected with @login_required.
3. Templates
base.html: The base layout template shared by all pages.
registration/login.html: Login form.
registration/logout.html: Logout confirmation message.
registration/register.html: User registration form.
registration/profile.html: Profile management form.
4. Forms
CustomUserCreationForm: Extends UserCreationForm to include an email field.
UserUpdateForm and ProfileUpdateForm: Used for profile management.
Authentication Process
1. Registration
Flow:
Navigate to /register/.
Fill in the username, email, and password fields.
Submit the form to create a new account.
Outcome:
Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to the login page.
Validation errors (e.g., mismatched passwords) are displayed on the form.
2. Login
Flow:
Navigate to /login/.
Enter the username and password.
Submit the form to log in.
Outcome:
Upon successful login, the user is redirected to /profile/ (or another page as defined by LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL).
Incorrect credentials result in an error message.
3. Logout
Flow:
Navigate to /logout/.
View the logout confirmation page.
Outcome:
Users are logged out and redirected to the login page (or a custom page defined by next_page in LogoutView).
4. Profile Management
Flow:
Navigate to /profile/ (requires login).
View and edit profile details (username, email, bio, profile picture, etc.).
Submit the form to save changes.
Outcome:
Updated information is saved to the database.
Validation errors are displayed if inputs are invalid.
Testing Instructions
1. Registration
Navigate to /register/ and register a new user.
Verify:
The form validation (e.g., passwords match, email is required).
The user is redirected to /login/ after successful registration.
2. Login
Navigate to /login/ and log in with the registered credentials.
Verify:
The user is redirected to /profile/.
Incorrect credentials display an error message.
3. Logout
Click the "Logout" link or visit /logout/.
Verify:
The user is logged out and redirected to /login/ (or a custom page).
Restricted pages (e.g., /profile/) now redirect to /login/.
4. Profile Management
Log in and navigate to /profile/.
Verify:
The profile form pre-fills with the user’s current information.
Changes to the profile are saved correctly.
Validation errors (e.g., invalid email) are handled properly.
